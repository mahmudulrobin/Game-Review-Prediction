As much as I wish to appraise this game, it cannot deserve a recommendation by me, the fact that you are so unforgivingly banned from matchmaking is pointless to say the least. I was disconnected due to internet hiccups for exactly 3 minutes and 24 seconds (Yes I timed it) and it gives me a 7 day ban. The thing that makes this so frustrating is that, it was the first match back after ANOTHER 7 day ban for similar issues. The fact that they do not forgive the fact that you may live in a woodland area where power can go out every now and again, or the fact that Steam can act buggy sometimes gets it a 3/10 from this CS veteran.2/15/15 Edit: I recieved yet another ban from matchmaking, this times issue was the following; I kicked too many teammates. Let me begin by reiterating that I had just finally gotten back after 2 weeks of no playtime due to internet issues and in this first game, a teammate began to throw the match, I.E. shooting teammates, or shooting in the air around enemies. Yes, someone (Not me) called a vote to kick him and I agreed because he's throwing the match, but appearantly in 2 weeks of no matchmaking play, one vote to kick got me ANOTHER 7 day ban. This is a continued portrayal to CS:GO's broken economy and has dropped my rating to 0/10, how can a game be rated greatly when it prevents all access to competetive players even when there's a fallacy involved?3/13/15 Edit: Another ban to add to this list; this time it's from being kicked too many times, giving me another 7 day, and here's how it happened. The game was a Comp. Office; the CT was whooping our asses so far, yet with me being second top on our team, three of the players who were in a team decided to kick me, because they cannot win. This further proves my thesis that CS:GO is still broken majorly when it comes to matchmaking bans; the utter fact that this game has the audasity (Phonics FTW) to allow things like this to keep happening with no way of appealing to anyone about getting it lifted.\\n\",\n"," 'Nice Game Forever !!\\n',\n"," 'literally the worst .... i have ever played\\n',\n"," \"Just...

This is a very old mod for Half-Life 1 which has now been released on Steam. I don't know why they bothered because it has not got Steam workshop and is very old now. The game defaults to a 4:3 640x480 resolution and you must manually change the video setting to Widescreen mode and then select your desired resolution. The game freezes on map load for about 30 seconds before you can play, if you click the mouse during this time it will crash to desktop.The maps autodownload on connection in traditional Half-Life fashion but it seems the developers have removed the rate limit of 2.5KB/s for server transfers as they download quite quickly now. Once the map has downloaded you will notice all of the textures are missing and you are running around a black and pink checkerboard map. Once again, no Steam workshop so you must manually hunt out the map and download it off the internet then extract it to your game folder and pray that the server hasn't changed maps by the time you go through this troublesome proceedure.The maps are seemingly designed for singleplayer as on a 6 player server it gets really messy with tons of people getting stuck in doorways/hallways as they are too narrow and you can't walk through other players. For whatever reason the players are actually objects that block you and make it a major pain to navigate the maps.Missing basic functionality such as changing your FOV from the options menu. You must go into console and write in default_fov ## to set your fov. The game doesn't save this settings between launches so you must manually go into your game folder and edit your autoexec.cfg in notepad just to change your FOV.This game is definitely showing its age and the developers don't seem to update it anymore as it missing a ton of basic features for a modern game.

I've heard of people experiencing quite a few issues, but the one issue I did encounter... was that my game is set to windowed mode by default. So, every so often, right click aim to left click shoot somebody would... close the game. But once, I set it to full screen, this problem disappeared, and I found myself quite enjoying the game.Sure some there may be downsides, but what game doesn't have downsides? The driving isn't great, so I find myself preparing to run everywhere. I also quite like the ability to travel on trains... it's something different. This of course, leads to the CTOS. The connections within the city, and how things link up together are quite interesting, especially when you chain hack cameras to get to your objectives without even needing to fire a shot, or enter the area. Hacking is quite the new mechanic, and while there isn't really anything new to it once you've done it a few times, it is very interesting and fun. Especially if you end up roaming and hacking a random passerby... for obscenely large amounts of cash they should not possibly have. Or you blow up a power box. Or change the traffic lights. Or, of course, activate blockers while being chased...Even without playing through the campaign, it is possible to have a lot of fun just free roaming around the map, helping ordinary civilians through crime prevention or doing other things like privacy invasion... The city of Chicago is realized quite well, and looks very nice. It is also interesting to see the detail put into every individual you encounter, and some of their descriptions, or vices, maybe, can be quite... amusing. As can some of the phone conversations or text exchanges you can listen in on or read.And last but not least: the campaign itself. While Watch_Dogs does not have an expansive cast of characters, they all accomplish their job quite well and the storyline is quite solid and interesting.Is it worth $75 (or maybe more or less, depending on where you live)? Maybe not, but the game is enjoyable. Watch_Dogs might not be a must-have, but it is certainly fun.\\n\",\n"," \"Let's go Bowling\\n\",\n"," 'What ruined this game is where it was based in asia far cry 2 was much better set in africa loved how you could burn fields and realistic environment what is say is far cry 4 looks like it is set in asia as well\\n',\n"," 'great game with a very well made feel and great balance.\\n',\n"," 'A must-get game\\n',\n"," 'DAY - 1 -I spawned in a cold area with very few dinos.

However I found the endless farming and feeding tedious and repetitive. This is however offset by new content.Understanding that the game is still in early access is important, there are allot of bugs and glitches that spoil the game. However they are quickly fixed and rarely does the same bug affect you more than once. Loading times for the game are terrible even on an SSD, this issues is what put me off the game the most having to preload my game 30 mins before I play is not fun.The game itself is fun and exciting, you have a totally open world where you must survive and live. The dinos are realistic and creative; they offer a great amount of enjoyment to this game! You level up as you play to unlock new items to build and endlessly farm to gain the materials needed to build new items.All in all the game is fun and enjoyable if you can overlook all the current issues it has, I have put well over 300 hours  into it and after about that amount of time it became repetitive and mundane, endlessly harvesting food and materials.If you are into survival games that require farming and RPG mechanics all rolled into one then this is your game!\\n',\n"," \"The guys at Bandai are just screwing with people, this game should be removed until an updated version is released equally to it's console counter-parts.

I first played this game on the PlayStation (when I was only young) I played it several times and again when it was released on PSN and now finally on Steam.Final Fantasy VII follows protagonist Cloud Strife a mercenary for hire who joins an eco-terrorist organisation AVALANCHE to stop Shinra from draining the life of the planet for use as a source of energy.Upon its release it was an immediate critical success.As with previous FF games it consists of three areas: A world map, field maps and a battle screen. What makes this game truly unique is the use of the turn-based battle system in which players command the characters in battles against CPU-controlled enemies. The skill system is based on Materia (magical orbs of condensed life energy) which are used for magic, summons and special abiliies.Good:-Hironobu Sakaguchi is a god-The story is simply amazing and it will literally take your breath away lol-Gameplay is amazing and winning battles against tough enemies is well rewarding (Emerald and Ruby Weapons)-The soundtrack is one the best ever composed in a video game, Nobou Uematsu the composer is a music god lol-The game truly redefined an era of RPGBad:-The Windows/Steam release uses PC MIDI files for its soundtrack which are terrible quality compared to the original on PlayStation, it is strongly recommneded to swap the files which you can do here: It deserves 10 foxes out of 10 foxes :D\\n',\n"," '*Changed review to negative.

I have never experienced playing the game on the EPIC settings but I have seen a few YouTubers play at those setting and my oh my does the game look great! Now you may be wondering why I have not recommended the game, that is due to the many problems that ARK faces such as extreme memory leaks and subpar optimisation, the memory leaks are a big problem for me as the game seems to eat up my RAM and spit it back out at me, I have heard the devs are trying to fix this issue but all I see is more content being put into the game which is good but also making the memory problem worse on mine and my friend's PCs. On multiple forum posts and other friend's first hand experiences I have heard memory leaks of up to 23 GBs! Not very healthy for a computer if you ask me :P All in all ARK: Survival Evolved is a great game but it sure does need some tuning up and until some of the problems are fixed that are causing people like me and others to not be able to play the game properly, I cant recommend the game to anyone unless they have a HIGH-end computer, but if you really want to play this game I recommend that you atleast have 16 GBs of RAM available if you want to run the game with mods.EDIT: I also forgot to mention that ARK: Survival Evolved has some of the longest loading times I have ever seen, so if you are fortunate enough to have an SSD with some room on it then install ARK on there.\\n\",\n"," 'when my anti-virus program detects this as a virus worries me\\n',\n"," \"This game is ruthlessly unforgiving, and equally as brilliant.

It's definately no doubt that I've enjoyed a lot with Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas in terms of the standalone games and the downloadable content.At least for me, I was able to buy the Season Pass of Fallout 4 on its initial price of almost 30 US dollars before Bethesda Softworks suddenly increased the price to almost 50 US dollars for some reason which I don't get.But take it from me, if you are really going to purchase the downloadable content from Fallout 4, it is wise to think ahead first if it's really worth it to consider buying Fallout 4's DLC.\\n\",\n"," \"AI Simualtor 1984 I mean Banished is fun for the first hour or so.Then... the AI's capabilities start to come into play.No matter how well you plan your town eventually all of your Lobotomites will end up starving except for one person who lives by himself who decided it was a good idea to have all of the town's crops for himself.

However, the current lack of items and things to do can make it very time consuming and monotoneus (yes, that's  what you would expect from a game in this genre, but its far more time consuming than it should be), but don't worry, your efforts will eventually pay off and give you a load of enjoyment and an almost real survival experience, with the occasional glitch.

It may seem tough and unforgiving when you first play it, but the more you play it and the more you learn, the more you will enjoy it! This game doesn\\'t hold your hand the whole way through which isn\\'t a bad thing. One bad thing about this game though is that the tutorials make absolutely no sense and doesn\\'t really help at all. This game will make you manage a colony of people, while dealing with things like starvation and monsters. It is by no means an easy game, but if your up for a challange, then I really must recommend this game because, even though it is not perfect, it is still entertaining. I give it a 6/10.\" -Snubbo 2014Well, I see that my oppinions have greatly changed. This was the period when I was engrossed in this game. Let\\'s just say that I no longer find any enjoyment out of this. This is a game with tutorials that are about as easy to understand and Astro Physics, the difficulty curve makes it really hard for newcomers and really annoying for anyone else. In this game you build a town, get people to move in, manage the food, water, ect. Eventually you may even get a warrior to move in. The problem is keeping your people alive, with the management system not quite working, which is a big problem in a game that is all about managing. Here is an example...You set some of you villagers to start picking apples, drop them off, and then cook them into pies. You then get the rest of your crew to go mining, with the help of some warriors. After about 20 seconds the warriors decide to wander off, 2 of the 5 you had get themselves killed, on the way to the apple and pear trees your villagers manage to drown themselves, the rest come up from mining to find no food and then die from starvation on the way to pick apples.The result is a game that doesn\\'t want you to enjoy it too much.

Most of the time, Call of Duty is a fast paced shooter with quite a lot going on. Well thats what it seems like to me.The game is good, dont get me wrong, it is enjoyable to play BUT there are some issues that should be addressed and taken into consideration when you click that add to cart button.1- What the game has become.The days of being able to use other weapons in game is over, being able to reliable cover a section of the map with an LMG or Sniper is no longer a play style that can be used. there was nothing that I loved more than being able to mow down 3 guys trying to flank your spawn on DOM. instead the game has become saturated by 1 specific play style.2- Rush.I can understand that Call of Duty is a fast FPS game, one of the easiest to play in that matter, you dont have to worry about bulletdrop like Battlefield, you dont have to worry about listening for footsteps or other sniper shots, Sniper Ghost Warrior but there is a limit in which how easy you can make it. both Black ops 2, Ghost and AW (I dont own AW but from friends that have the game) are saturated with the use of SMGs and/or Shotguns, having small maps really makes the efficieny of using a Sniper almost obselete, LMG users are constantly being dominated by the fast firing high DMG smgs you find in BO3, yet when it comes to balancing things....3- How to guide: Balancing Weapons.after using the Haymaker 12 for quite sometime now there are a few things that I do not understand   -Somehow, it is the shotgun with the least amount of damage, yet, fires a buckshot, like most of the shotguns in BO3   -I am consistanly getting hate for using the weapon, note most of the people that are hating on me, get to close.You See, Treyarch fail to see that there is a difference between Balance and butthurt, Balance, is not nerfing the crap out of a weapons to turn it into a waterpistol, that is what you get when a whole bunch of people dont like being killed by the Haymaker, the simple counter measure to a shotgun is to not get so close to someone, simple as that. but when balancing weapons, also take into consideration where the complaints are coming from. This could be from places like reddit, youtube etc, once you read these comments, actually take some time to look at statistics, I am sure you have some spare time while monkeys are fixing the issues with the game to make things right. there is nothing more than seeing a game saturated and dominated by fast firing SMGs with have the range of a sniper... Im not just saying this because I get killed byt SMGs quite a lot, but more so that it is true. for example, if you look at say the Vesper, chuck rapid fire, laser sight and fast mag. You pretty much has a lightweight minigun.there are positives to the game, the zombies is spot on, I love it!, have enjoyed every single moment of it!, especially when you disconnect from Singleplayer....Multiplayer, although has a fair amount of issues, is fun.but my main complaint for the game, is the constant FPS spikes/stutters... any kind of help I look for either says update the drivers or get a better computer... I have updated the drivers, which had pretty much no effect what-so-ever, getting a better computer well, I think I have good enough specks to be honest (i7-2600, HD7950 and 8GB ram).Dont you find it sad how, supposedly, Creating a sequal to what was quite a good game (Black ops 2) take such a downfall, games are meant for enjoyment, being able to communicate with friends, and all the people that have apparently slept with your mother. Dont you feel dissapointed in YOUR inability to fix the mistakes and become a better overall game developer. Isnt it demoralising when you see that just under 50% of the comments/reviews on the game are Negative?

Multiplayer is a whole different thing, however still very disappointing. I played the co-op exo survival mode and died every within 2 rounds because the game would lag, I was in my own private server, lowest settings once again. This game uses up to 40% of my CPU and that is crazy, slowing my computer down a fair bit. Anyway, whenever I try to play online at any given time, it takes a while to find a game (because no one seems to be playing it either), and then once a game is found it will load and just before it goes into the level, the game crashes.0.1/10 would play again in a decade and then remember it was crap.

My setup is an FX-8320 overclocked to 4700Mhz, with practically the same performance as an Intel core i7-4790K. But the game insists in using just 2 modules (2 cores in case of an intel processor) of my 4 modules with 8 threads processor. This is not about the fanboy battle about “AMD sucks”, this is serious, even the new core i7-6700K ( 3 times more costly than my FX) can’t pull more than 45 FPS with a huge graphic card. Also I have a Radeon R9 290X (1040Mhz) that can run everything in ultra 1080p/1440p or medium 2160p. But here I can’t pull more than 45 fps in High settings. That’s not good optimization. People with similar setups (i7-4770/90K GTX 970/980) have the same problem, just 2 cores being used making FPS drops and stutter as a result. I can’t understand why high end graphics cards like the R9 290/X, 390/X, GTX 970, 980/ Ti can’t run the game in ultra at 60 FPS, logic says I should be able run this game in 1440p without problems. Also I have big FPS drops in my huge base in hidden lake, reaching low 30 to 25 FPS. I probably have to be thankfull to run the game in stable 35 FPS (capped with AMD Framerate target control to avoid jumping between 70 to 40 constantly) with nearly ultra settings, but not everyone has a high setup like mine.Edit 27 jun: update 243.9 \"* Fixed significant performance issues with dual-core CPUs\" It makes the game even more \"dual core\" optimized. I detected even less FPS (-20% CPU bound FPS from 30 FPS in my huge base to 26)DON\\'T BUY THIS GAME.

Before Arkham Asylum was released, the gaming world was still in question about why another comic book game was going to be released, especially as they were all such a letdown. Batman is a widely known hero and making a game about him and his legacy is not easy. Well it turns out that Rocksteady knew their stuff and Arkham Asylum was hailed as the BEST comic book game of all time. How could a sequel possibly be better than Arkham Asylum? Fast forward to 2011, the highly anticipated release of Arkham City. Does it live up to the hype?To put it simply, it does. Batman: Arkham City is a perfect example of how passion and knowledge of the core content can create a terrific piece of gaming. Arkham City, has shifted setting from the moody Asylum into the gritty Arkham City. Once again, the world created by Rocksteady here is immersive, huge and looks beautiful. Arkham City is full of things to see and do from the 15 or so lengthy side missions and the 400+ Riddler objectives to complete. The side missions here are fleshed out and are extremely varied, which ultimately creates interesting stories about the various characters which the player encounters through Batman’s time within Arkham City. Completing these side objectives are given meaning through the different decisions that Batman must take/decide, which results in meaningful story and character development. The Riddler trophies this time around are more plentiful and come with tougher puzzles than before. These pesky trophies are addictive to collect and have been hidden in the least expected places. Obtaining these trophies feels rewarding and satisfying as you’re one step closer to shutting down the Riddler’s operation. After collecting a certain number of these trophies, a mission to save a hostage appears on the map, and these missions are a welcome addition to the content that Rocksteady has already provided. Trophies aren’t the only thing related to the Riddler however. Riddler’s Revenge combat, predator and campaign maps are back, but are given more thought and is fleshed out with much more content than Arkham Asylum. The freeflow combat is amazing as it was in Arkham Asylum. Combos, takedowns, throws, etc. are back and it feels extremely smooth. The new gadgets that are obtained through the story mode and other side content add to Batman’s arsenal found in Arkham Asylum, and can be freely used in all combat sequences, not just the Riddler Revenge maps. This signifies the amount of freedom and player choice that Rocksteady has given to the player by giving them the option to progress through the game anyway they desire. Story wise, Batman: Arkham City is well written and intricately designed. Characters evoke emotion and are introduced in meaningful ways, and the way these characters are introduced doesn’t feel rushed. Story missions are also well executed by slowly increasing in difficulty through each combat and predator encounter, resembling smooth flow between missions so as not to feel repetitive. Boss fights are better than Arkham Asylum and require more thought. The story is also quite lengthy. Expect to invest at least 12 hours just to complete the games storyline.Game of the Year edition is basically the base game released in 2011 but with the inclusion of all character packs and story DLC, Harley Quinn’s Revenge. Being able to play as Catwoman, Robin and Nightwing feels refreshing. It is evident that Rocksteady has put in their knowledge and passion of Batman history through these characters as they all possess different combat moves, which then requires different tactics and experimentation from the player. Rocksteady has employed a wise tactic by giving the player the choice to play as their “favourite character”, meaning that more hours can easily be invested into the game, as to master these new characters. Although being able to play as these characters is a nice break from playing as Batman, it would have been nice to play as these characters in the world instead of restricting them to just the challenge maps. The Harley DLC is also quite a nice inclusion as it adds to the already lengthy game time. The story isn’t as deep as Arkham City, but it is an enjoyable ride getting through Harley’s goons for 3 or 4 hours.The only downside to the game are that some of the early characters introduced in the game are underused or never even seen as the story progresses. This is a shame, especially for a game of such caliber that these iconic characters would miss out on their opportunity. At least these characters could be used more in a side mission or be seen later on through an Easter egg, in which the game has many.Not addressing everything the game does well, the smooth freeflow combat, intense predator stealth sequences, well written and engaging storyline, immersive open world, plentiful side missions along with the plethora of collectibles and Easter eggs make Batman: Arkham City a long lasting and near perfect game that actually makes the player feel like the Bat. Expect to throw away at least 50 hours of your life as you experience what this awesome game has to offer.9.8/10\\n',\n"," 'FEELS THE SAME as the first one\\n',\n"," 'Como puede ser que compre el juego por 15.99 Dolares y no me funcione!!

I love how the game gives players different tasks and makes them get seperated and cover eachother. It just feels... interesting. Also, killing ememies is incredibly satisfying. Some of the boss battles are sort of cool, like the one on the second chapter of Chris 'n' Piers' campaign. Also, if you play it with a friend, laughing at the many broken things you find is awesome.

This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness.

The game definitely rewards skill and with great precision you can kill even the highest levelled players. The combat can be frustrating when you get completely stunlocked by another player, which is especially frustrating for a new player who does not understand the game yet and is attempting to learn the mechanics. In terms of the gameplay, this game is very good.The second thing that I have noticed is that this game is EXTREMELY unbalanced. Although the game claims that it will match you with players of \"equal level and skill\", it is lying to you. At level 1, you will get matched with level 20 players that have full sets of gear and will tear you apart. This makes learning the basics of the game very difficult. It also makes the game somewhat unfair. They definitely need to fix the matchmaking in this game ASAP. It deters new players (like myself) almost immediately from wanting to play the game any further. The gameplay is great and so is the game itself, but this level of unbalance and the feeling of it being unfair from the very beginning has made me turn my decision and not recommend this game for the moment. The learning curve is too great for you to be thrown into a game full of high level players.I hope that this gets changed soon, I see real potential in this game.\\n',\n"," 'This game is difficult to control but that just makes for so many hilarious moments\\n',\n"," ':D\\n',\n"," 'The trailer was great, the actual short movie is pretty average (almost want to call it lame).

But this transition happens in a space of half an hour and the game turns for the worse after the game becomes 3D. After that it becomes a bad zelda and final fantasy clone.The turn-based strategy is way too easy, as your partner has a heal spell that is effective considering how little damage the enemies do. She doesn't do a whole lot of damage (except for x-crystal, but the hero can do just as well.), there is no limit on how many times you can use her spell and it heals both characters. At the moments when she isn't around, you have enough money to buy a bunch of potions to last you until your partner comes back. Because of this, the battles will get boring and mind-numming very quickly and you'll start running from battles just to get past them.The action-adventure gameplay isn't as bad, as some of the levels have intresting mechanics like shifting back and forth from 16-bit to 3D but these sections don't last as long and they don't get repeated. They should've stuck with these ideas as it could've added more puzzles and ways to get around them. Instead it focuses more on the combat, which is stiff to say the least.Overall, it takes a lot of ideas, some from other games and some entirely unique, and sticks it all together instead of getting a few ideas and expanding upon thoses to make the game feel like an exploration through the action/adventure genre rather than a game that took ideas from other games in hope of it working well. Combined the fact that the game is really short and that it's $10, this game isn't worth getting.\\n\",\n"," 'This game was fun and all when I first started, I was also reaaally baad.But then, after a couple of days I started getting better.So good infact that a buch of ....... squeakers got so butthurt they reported me, ALL OF THEM.Now my account is \"Globally Untrusted\" and on cooldown.So if you\\'re the really competitive type, do not get this game.You cannot be better than anyone.\\n',\n"," 'This game WILL reset your characters!

Garry's Mod is a mod of Valve's Half-Life 2. Garry Newman, the man behind the mod, decided to make a map, put some tools in, copy and paste content from the Half-Life 2 folder and call it a game. I remember when this game was 20.00$ back when it looked interesting enough to check out, but with only being a kid with no money, and having a father who doesn't trust buying things on the internet, I was out of luck, so about 2 years later when I had my own card to buy the game with, it felt like the first time kissing a girl, amazing. After everything was all set, actually playing the game, and figureing out how to play was a pain in the as*s. Then, with a website full of content that other people made, and not knowing how to install said downloaded content, was all the more frustrating. Then the big 13 update came along with the workshop so the communnity could hold the mod's hand the whole time, just one problem, the whole game changed so nothing that I learned sinked, all the new features made no sense to a normal player such as my self. To sum it all up, if you want to play this game and have any actual fun, you have to Have no life and learn how to use every feature in the game. If you want to play Multiplayer you have the pleasure of being ..... by doushbag admins, along with having to tollerate ear shattering sounds of little kids crying in the process, while your bing anally destroyed, as the old saying goes, the only winning move is not to play. The only reason to get this mod is to mess around with the Team Fortress 2 stuff, that's why I have it. If you don't have it, and your deciding to buy it or not, if someone tells you that it's something worth trying out, the person your talking to is not your friend, it's probably someone who has Garry's di*ck 1.54 inches in their as*s, probably Milfof6D9.

I bought this game a few months back when it was $20 and it was worth it. It's a fairly challenging coop shooter with Zombies and it's a lot of fun. Plus it's 3 games in one, so for $8.99 it's a steal. This game features the stories from NZA 1 and 2 with updated textures, an exclusive third story continuing on from the other two that you can only buy in this collection, and a decent survival mode which is also exclusive to the trillogy. All are available in 4 player coop.It has a fairly healthy online community, but it's certainly best with friends, which is why I don't have much time on it. That said, it has a certain dark humour to its story which makes it both endearing, but also a bit terrifying at times. If you're a fan of Call of Duty Zombies, particularly World at War, you'll probably love this. I have a fairly mid range PC (AMD FX-6300, R9 270x) and I run this at 80 fps 1080p on high with supersampling off and it runs beautifully. The graphics are pretty decent too.If using an Xbox controller is your thing, the controller support is fantastic. Simply turn it on at any point and it'll work just fine. I use a 360 controller, but the game most certainly supports an Xbone controller too (it's image is used in the controls section of the options).Basically, buy it now while it's on sale because it's great.

I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.I thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.overall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title.

THe pure comical action with the witty and slandish british comedy that riddles the game is fantastic, and the FPS mechanics are just perfect (although there are a few glitches in the system when changing weapons and such, but this is mainly due to the inferiority of the engine not that actual game, and they are quite bearable)The Visuals are decent, not fantasitic or amazing, but they will satisfy you, for the game itself makes up for that.

I tried to be witty there.Now, I'm not one to do really large reviews, but I can tell you this: Buy this game.A ton of people will go on and on about how it sucks, how it's stupid, but it's a really fun RPG game for those that are into the genre. And a lot of people have gone on to say that it's just a time waster, but no, it's more than that. Like an RPG game, it'll take you into the story the best it can. It's up to you, if you let it do it's job or not.And as such, this took me to believe that not many people gave it that starting chance. The chance to change their lives forever.Now, you might be thinking I'm biased, and yeah, I am. I never got the chance to grow up with great games that were released on older gen consoles. Like the NES, the SNES, and even the Sega Mega Drive. I got to miss the truly astonishing ups and lows of gaming history. All because I'm a kid. So, when a game like this comes along, a game that does so well at giving the player a feel of the old world, I take it like it's a van full of candy.But, TL;DR: Buy this game if you're into the genre, you won't regret it.\", 'Wub wub wub, Catch some gun!!!

Game play is basic you pick a perk (Demolitions (grenade launchers and my fav), Support (shotgun and welder), Sharpshooter (pistols and rifles), Berserker (Melee weapons), Pyro (flame based weapons), Medic (Obvious), Commando (Assault rifles). You can purchase weapons of any class at the end of a wave at a trader which is open for a variable amount of time based on settings. In addition to your weapons every class has a medic gun and a welder (both work only at melee range) but their effectiveness is based on your perk. You can weld certain doors and gates closed letting you hold off the horde that little while longer. Guns sound awesome, a decent variety for each class. You are limited by a weight limit for how many weapons you can carry though (not by slots). The base game has quite a few maps including a couple of objective maps as well as a few sandbox settings and difficulty levels. The base game is quite fun for the first few weeks but starts to get samey/grindy which is why i HIGHLY recommend to play on a modded server. There is also a lot of things on the workshop page (especially modded maps) which i also recommend checking out too. The workshop is why i kept playing from 30 hours onward. The game also has holiday orientated events (Halloween redneck zombies, evil Santa)Graphics are okay (game is a couple of years old) and it is very gory with no geo block :D. Which is why the demo class is so fun XD. Sounds are pretty good, guns feel nice (especially the 9mm). Maps vary from open, outdoors, corridors, small e.c.t so there is a lot of variety there.

Except in this game, you get to play as the machines taking over the world. The gameplay is fun, and very satisfying. The visuals are nice. They are somewhat akin to that of Katamari Damacy. As of right now, there are only 3 modes, all of which have different goals (Did not get to play the Sandbox Mode when I tried the game, but it's basically like the other modes, just with no goal). In arcade mode, you try to destroy as much as possible, to score as high as possible within 3 minutes. In Gman elimination mode, you must destroy a certain number of MIB (Men In Black) before the time runs out. Overall, the game was fun, and should get better with more refining whilst in early access. The only gripe I have with the game, is that the controls feel a little strange, mainly when operating the camera when you aren't in a vehicle, and are searching for one to control on the map.

Each class on each team has access to different guns, attachments etc. And you have a set amount of equipment tokens/points to spend on your loadout. You also have a weight meter which can determine whether your loadout will make you run fast or slow, and how fast your stamina will run out.Now lets get into the combat:The combat is fast paced at times and slow paced at others, you will constantly find yourself having to visually inspect whether you have killed a person and wondering \"should i check or should i run past and hope the enemy is dead\". From the last sentence you probably can tell the game is going to be realistic. It is. If you move up on your own your playing a wild card, instead you might want to call out a couple of your teammates to help you complete/capture an objective (Yes, there are a lot of different gamemodes to choose from, most of which include control areas). There is virtually no HUD (Heads Up Display), the only things that do show up on the hud is how many magazines you have, and info about the objective(s). The gunplay is realistic, recoil is a thing and attachments can supress that recoil but also you can by swithing modes on your gun or burst firing. 1-2 bullets from most guns can take down an enemy.Lets talk graphics:The graphics in the game are not spectactular, but still enough to immerse you in the gameplay, though the design and textures on the weapons look great. You can\\'t really expect a game run and made on the source engine  and is only slightly modified is going to get you amazing Battlefield graphics.Overall Gameplay:The gameplay is realistic, tense and rewarding if you play the game right, what a mordern military shooter should be, it offers great and realistic gunplay, a variety of gamemodes and maps.

Once you are done deciding which hero you want you can unlock 1 hero for free to lvl it to 60 (I suggest taking Deadpool 1st, since he has no energy cost and is fun to play).   Everytime you play the game, the game will drop Eternity Splinters for you to pick up, don\\'t ignore them. You can use those Eternity Splinters to buy more heroes from the \\'Eternity Splinter\" vendor. You don\\'t need to spend real/steam money for playing the game. The only thing you can might need to spend money is the costumes, but random costumes can be crafted too when you do Prestige. Prestige is releveling a hero from 0 to 60 once again, everytime you prestige you get a original costume of a hero, you can use 3 of the original costumes to craft 1 random costume.  There is atleast 1 event going on every month which will keep you hooked up to the game. The devs make sure the events are glitch-free.  The only thing I don\\'t like about this game is that the default inventory is too short, and the Eternity Splinter price of STASH is also too high (600 Splinters) which takes long time to aquire compared to Random hero unlock box (175 Splinters).

Being a big fan of the original installment, when I heard about the second installment, I was excited. Did this game manage to live up to the excitement? Yes, Definitely! The only \"flaw\" currently that I have found is the lack of content, BUT! This game is in Early Access and more content will obviously be added. From the (as of 24/04/2015) 4 hours that I spent playing this game, both solo and with friends, I feel like this game has incredible promise.The good:*Visuals - This game\\'s visuals are stunning. The graphics have received a very nice upgrade from this game\\'s predecessor, without taking away from the style that the first game portrayed.*Performance - This game has very good optimization. I was able to run the game on medium to high on my low end PC and still manage a stable 60fps, with only a few ocassional drops.*Gore - The gore system got a massive overhaul, which just makes it so much more satisfying to blow the heads off of Zeds and watch it literally explode, spraying everything in blood. Each Zed has a huge amount of points of dismemberment, so you can quite literally tear them limb for limb.*UI - The user interface got some heavy tweaking compared to the first game, making everything more sleek and easy to access. The Vendor Pod has a very nice interface as well, with everything laid out infront of you without having to scroll down or across.*Classes - Although only 4 of the classes are available at this point in time, the skills/class perks feel rewarding for the effort you put in. *SDK - The game has been noted to have the SDK and community creations implemented later on in development, which is great, as I found the community creations one of the best parts of the first game.*Humour - That\\'s right, the wonderful British banter from the first game makes a comeback, better than ever. I mean who doesn\\'t love British people insulting zombies. :P*Dosh - Aww yis, the dosh now has physics! You can literally make piles of money. When encountered with large crowds, it can be quite annoying being spun around every couple of seconds having to bash a zed away, only to be grappled by another one and spun around. I personally preferred the grappling from the first game, where they just slow down your movement, until you can\\'t move.*Servers - I\\'m giving the game credit with this one, but I\\'m just going to list it here for the time being, since I consider it a negative part. (At this point in time). Currently the servers that are available are almost all full, with only a few with much higher latency being available. All of the ones with great ping and empty are privated however. This wouldn\\'t be too much of a problem, but as of this point in time, the method for creating a dedicated server for the game is quite tedious. >Also, I\\'m not sure if this is a glitch, but 90% of the time, when a game is finished I am often sent back to the main menu screen, even on my friend\\'s game<All in all, if you\\'re a fan of the original installment, I\\'d highly recommend picking this up. If you\\'re a bit sceptical about purchasing games that are in Early Access, I\\'d probably suggest giving this one a miss until the price drops for a sale, as there currently isn\\'t too much content. If you\\'ve never played the first game in the franchise, but you\\'re interested in Zombie Survival games, such as Left 4 Dead, I recommend giving this game a try. I can definitely see myself sinking more hours into this game as it develops.', 'If you start playing Competitive mode 5 vs 5, its over, no other MP FPS will matter to you.Still my favorite FPS Multiplayer series.', 'sweet/10', 'This is an incredibly relaxing game featuring an amazing soundtrack and great gameplay.

I can say the same for the Far Cry series too.  I suppose I could add Just Cause to the list it beats but I have only played 3 hours of JC2 after getting a little tired of it, the same can't be said for SR3 though, it made me want to come back for more and more!Saints Row 2 was indeed a poor port in the fact that driving was fairly hard as the game played at an increased speed.

The game is well made and the continuous content updates are great, a good thing that separates Golbal Offensive from Source is the new guns and the weapon skins for each gun giving you the ability to have cooler looking guns, and more importantly StatTrak which gives players who can afford it the ability to count their kills. The micro-transactions in this game are not forced onto you but it is a good way to gamble, like if you spend $20 on an unboxing and get a $120 knife from it you made profit, or you lose money (that is why it's gambling), and the operations which give you earlier access to community made maps and keep a personal record of your competitive scores. This game is one of the best First Person Shooters out there and I'd give it a 9/10. The EMS competitions give players the chance to try get their name out there in the CS:GO community and also win big cash, and for those who are not a good enough player who can't assemble a team it is great fun to wath.\", 'A beautiful game with a soundtrack to remember', 'nice', 'Very Tactics, much stratergy, so aliens ultimate respect source matirael.

Jokes aside they are most likely blind and are way below the system specs to play this fantastic masterpiece of a game.And so what if Sean Murray lied? Subnautica has higher ratings and that's not even as big as No Man's Sky. And Subnautica has almost the same graphics as NMS so what's your problem?! Sure, multiplayer may or may not be implented because of ONE INCIDENT. But even if Sean Murray lied about that just accept the way NMS is! Not as many Subnautica features were lied about but even if they were, what difference would it make? The same's with NMS. Subnautica doesn't have Multiplayer, and so what? NMS doesn't either! Review No Man's Sky is actually a very fun game to play. Watching it is boring as hell, though. I immediately got hooked into the game as soon as I started playing. Unfortunately this game isn't for everyone. There's little variety in the genre and it really sticks to one thing; Exploration. If you can't stand exploring planets on foot and seeing different terrains, this game isn't for you.Also you can't build in No Man's Sky, just pointing that out.Now here's the good bit. On every planet you go to, all the animals' voices are different, they look different, EVERYTHING. IS. DIFFERENT. No joke, even the plants! On every planet! Imagine that, a game with everything completely unique to the last planet you visited. Nifty eh?Now no game is perfect and the same's with this game. Obviously this is indie so I won't be too harsh. Pros • Endless, unique gameplay.• Two different endings: Galactic Core and Atlas Path.• Every single creature is never the same from the last ones you saw on a different planet.• Ship varieties. (I often wait around at space stations waiting for an epic looking one)• Awesome soundtrack that plays throughout your gameplay.• 3 different races you can trade with, all with unique voices.• Massive exploration on either barren, rocky planets to lush planets filled with trees and life. Cons • Eventually gets a tiny bit repetitive.• To save, you must find a shelter. You can't just save anywhere.• Hard to find a good ship with lots of slots• Hard to get better Hyperdrives to travel to better systems (from worst to best, Yellow, Red, Green,      Blue)• Slow start.

Matching up against others who have superior cards or/even duplicates or sets of 4 card(s) whom have purchased additional boosters, not only makes deck building difficult, ineffective but also increases the likelihood that you will be demorilised over and over again in matches against other opponents in 1 v 1 or free for all matching.I generally enjoy purchasing this product for the puzzle games, Last turn puzzles a few years ago were amazing and difficult/challanging. 2014 however showcases some very sub par puzzles games and this year, well, there are none.I played one game of free for all on 4 v 4 and I felt so far away from the game table I requested my flatmate to provide me a magnifine glass. myself and another player also realised 4 turns in that we had already lost when one of the players threw down some superior cards for which we had not even access to.This put me off continuing playing this game into the future as really there is no point unless I am wishing to invest into this.Suggestions would be to at least bring \"two headed giant\" match making back, a level par card selection by perhaps charging a set $15 fee from the start and not this \"micro transaction booster option\" which is poor oversight in my opinion and perhaps even a tournament mode where equal par magic the gatherers could paticipate tournaments of 10 players etc, round robin to then provide a level based system and a decent points rating for those wishing to climb to the top in rankings over time (by winning more tourney\\'s etc)Rating, interface, music score, Story concept 6/10 (as what else can you do with a story really)gameplay campaign 5/10 (as well the AI seems to get the perfect run of cards sometimes :S)Deck building feature, 8/10 as this is very flexibleCard selection 2/10 (extremely limited unless additional investments made)gameplay vs human 3/10 (for the reason you will become frustate that you are unable to build a deck that is consistent without investment into more booster packs)Overall I would probably rate Magic 2015 4/10', \"This game is really bad, i think that anyone that see's the trailer thinks it is good, that y i got it.

Hope they fix access issues!!!', 'Hack, Slash, Loot, or \"HSL\", looks charming at first with it\\'s retro-style pixel art... until you realize that the gameplay is even more primitive. It is not an understatement to say that everything in this game either comes down to little more than random chance and comparing numbers. Combat is completely limited to clicking on an enemy until they die. That\\'s it. No special moves, no abilities, no changing gear, nothing. Sure, depending on your weapon you either use melee, ranged or magic attacks, but unless you\\'re fighting near a weapon drop you can\\'t change on the fly, plus your character will usually specialize in one type so there\\' very little reason to change unless you get VERY skewed consumable drops (more on that later). At best you can try to bottleneck enemies in doorways or tight coriidors to fight them one by one, or run away and hope you find something useful before you get surrounded, but that barely qualifies as \"strategy\". And even then, you still have to hope that RNGesus is smiling down upon you. The item system is almost as primitive. Most of the time, it feels less like you are trying to decide which weapon or piece of armor to equip, and more like you\\'re just comparing numbers (although special damage types such as the stunning Lighting do make things a little more interesting) As for consumables, you never know if a potion or w/e will help and/or hinder you, meaning once again it\\'s entirely up to luck rather than any sort of choice or strategy if it help you.Oh, and there\\'s no save system. At all.All in all, this game had a lot of potential, but instead the gameplay is comparable to banging your head against a wall while comparing helmets and popping pills that \"might\" make it hurt less. What this game needed was something, ANYTHING that might have made the gameplay more complex than dice rolling: Abilities/items to use in a pinch, swapping around weapons, etc etc: anything that would make success less dependant on how lucky you are.

The main purpose of this online game is to gather provisions, build a base, and defend said base against raids, or you can raid other bases. I have two major problems with it though. 1) the game's servers frequently reset, which can be every week, or more. This results in the base you spent so much time building, which may be days, to be erased. 2) as I mentioned, you can raid bases or be raided by other players. However, you are left vulnerable whilst you are offline. So people can raid your base while you're not there to defend it.

The team that manages the engine and physics are quite good, though not the best. Aircraft and vehicle modelleling is the greatest I\\'ve seen for a game with such a variety of vehicles. Gameplay is amazingly smooth and simple.I cannot recommend it due to many controversial decisions made by the developers. Ignoring the playerbase in terms of balancing the matchmaking. Gaijin have created a problem that only becomes worse. When there are many players playing a large range of vehicles, (generally) effective matchmaking would clump a few evenly matched vehicles together for an intense fight.However if a vehicle was introduced/\"balanced\" to be too effective/ineffective, naturally people would flock/avoid that vehicle. This creates increased queue times due to the inbalance of demand of vehicles. People complain and Gaijin allows a wider variety int he one game, this can (and did) lead to further imbalance. Thus, more people avoid it/leave. This makes the balancing act harder and both Gaijin and the playerbase stressed.Of course, this depends on your reason on playing War Thunder and the matchmaking may not be a concern, also Gaijin isn\\'t doing too badly at the moment, it\\'s just greatly inconsistent matchmaking leading to either utter defeat or victory simply due to vehicle selection and not player skill.Any aircraft could easily kill a much higher tiered aircraft if they\\'re not using their speed advantage or experience. I have killed MiG-15\\'s in an F6F Hellcat. However in ground forces, it is practically impossible to kill a much higher tiered tank due to their armor and firepower keeping you at a massive disadvantage.Game Modes:Arcade Battles:Best place to learn the ropes, manoeuvres target leading, positioning, awareness and map knowledge. Physics have been tweaked for faster gameplay and easier to handle aircraft. This mode is where I spent about half of my time on, learning how to fly different types of aircraft and their weapons. Ground forces arcade is very intense and can be very much run, gun, die repeat. Dodging cannons rounds and ramming enemies off cliffs.Realistic Battles:Common for more skilled players like myself. Vehicles perform closely to historical documents (which aren\\'t the most accurate due to multiple sources). Requires extensive knowledge of own vehicle, enemies and map to effectively defeat the enemy. In this game mode, teamwork and communication is also introduced. (Yes, teamwork and communication is almost non-existent in arcade) NOTE: Although teamwork is indeed key, people are people and will sometimes be selfish or ignorant which can lead to many losses. You basically have to hope that your team isn\\'t braindead to charge the enemy into a disadvantaged position.Simulator Battles:What is this? DEAD :(In aircraft used to force cockpit views and requires a joystick (although with practice you can go without). It tries to have the primary components of real combat without having to worry about issues real pilots have. Can be very intense however it has an extreme learning curve and almost certainly requires a wingman. Like RB, however these skills are truly put it to the test.The game indeed has its great moments, when the odds are stacked even greater against you than the developers intended and you still break through.

I got this dlc as a part of my season pass, so I didn't pay the $9.99 price tag. But if you didn't buy a season pass and are considering buying this dlc separately, I recommend you do not.There are really only two new characters with a decent amount of interaction introduced in this dlc. One I felt was developed very well, and will keep as a companion for a while. The other, was very shallow. There was barely any character development to make me feel anything for them. They could have been a no name raider and plucked at the same heartstrings during the big choice of this dlc.The robot customisation added by this dlc is quite neat. All of it balances nicely with no obvious power play options. And it's fun to have your own custom companion. But this, ultimately, is no different to any other companion. Sure, I can give them sword arms, but I could just give another companion a sword for the same effect. The interface is also slightly confusing; it is difficult to follow what change in damage/resistance a mod will cause without doing the manual check yourself. I was beginning to trust those little +++.Coming into this dlc with a lv 50 character (playing on survival) I really only felt challenged on combat at one stage in this dlc. That's not isolated to this dlc though, I feel fallout 4 has difficulty issues regardless. But this dlc does nothing to rectify this.Oh and if you're not a junk hoarder then I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors amassing your new hoard if you want to build any decent robot mods.There are a few new weapons added in this dlc as well, with the majority being mele, then energy. These are not something a level 50+ is going to start using though. Even with full modification, they fail to pack any considerate punch.There are also some unique power armor mods added in this dlc, but they are non transferable and will only benefit energy weapons users.In the end this dlc adds some cool features to your settlement and a cool new companion, but other than that there is nothing really new that is worth the $9.99 pricetag if you're considering buying this dlc outright.\", \"i can't even join lobbys.

So in conclusion, this game is probably one of the worst Triple A title games you will ever purchase and whether the Triple A title is worth $15 or $100 (like this one) this game is definitely not worth it in anyway.

When I discovered I could only install this on 3 machines I was quite disappointed. Ubisoft support also seems seriously lacking. My son recently made purchase of a hardcopy ubisoft title, registered it to his account but could not download it - was just stuck in a registration loop. He was outright ignored by Ubisoft/Uplay official support contact - even after posting for help on their Facebook page. Eventually he exchanged the game for something worth twice as much (and not needing Uplay). So he posted again to their facebook to let them know he didnt want their assistance anymore because they are useless and he had solved his problem. Within minutes they deleted his post from the page making us well aware that Uplay had seen his original help request but they had deliberately ignored it.I'd hate to see what will happen when I have to contact them for a new key for Anno when I next upgrade my machine. If the same DRM restrictions exist for the new Anno when it is released I simply wont be buying it ... ever.

Really fun and there is a lot to do in the game that makes you want to continue to play. There are unlockables like Perks, Offerings, Clothes, Items, Addons etc. You can level up your characters as well as your rank for both Survivor and Killer.You can also play private matches with your friends and you won\\'t lose anything if you do die as a survivor.The ranking system in my opinion is good enough for now; you collect these crystals (at least they look like crystals) called PIPS, according to the official Dead By Daylight Manual, and when you collect a certain amount in a row,  you get promoted. The lowest rank in the game is 20 and the highest rank is 1. To get from rank 20-19 you must collect 3 pips. From Rank 12 and onwards, you must collect 5 pips each rank down, meaning Rank 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 require 5 pips each before you get to Rank 1 for both Survivor and Killer.So the game seems cool, right? Well, most games aren\\'t that perfect...TLDR: Great Game, Fun, Lost of Unlockables, makes you want to continue playing, Private Matches, Ranking System, Collect Pips to Rank Up, Rank 20 lowest rank, Rank 1 Highest Rank.NEGATIVESThe only way to rank up in the game is to play public matches, and this makes it difficult because people try and find their friends so they search and quit lobbies until they find them because you currently CANNOT invite your friends to public matches, only private matches, and some players just boost each other. For example one person plays as the killer, hosting the lobby and the other playing as a survivor, and they troll you. There are many disadvantages in the game too, such as:- The host of every game is the killer. This is bad because almost every killer in the game has a .... ISP.- Everybody is searching for their friends, and sometimes it can take a while to find a game. The longest it took me to once find a game was 1 hour for this reason...- You will lag in almost EVERY game.- You WILL rage.- You WILL die in stupid ways.- You WILL get stuck in objects.- There are HACKERS in this game too!Now it\\'s time to elaborate on these points. The killer being the host of every game really annoys me, just because it gives them a huge advantage. Think of it like this; The host controls everything, and you and your friends are normal people doing normal stuff. But the host has .... internet, and because he controls everything, it affects you and your friends WAY more than it does for him. As a matter of fact, it doesn\\'t affect him at all. LAG will ruin you, and make you rage. I\\'ve lost many games just because of lag. But how does the lag affect you in game? Well, when you attempt to vault over something, like a wall or object, and you\\'re lagging, you are going to die, especially if the killer\\'s chasing you, because what happens is that rather than vaulting, your character FREEZES. Lag also makes you teleport literally everywhere and will get you killed. This is why you will rage and die in the most stupidest ways.You will also get stuck in objects. One time I spawned into a game (The developers call these TRIALS) and I was repairing a generator. Then the killer was coming towards me and I was thinking, \"Oh no problem, I will just hide behind this tree.\" So I go behind \\'This tree\\' and crouch and he walks past me. \"Yeh I\\'m all good.\" I think to myself. Then I go to walk away from the tree and then just like that, I was stuck. I literally couldn\\'t move, and the murderer was coming back. He walked past me again and didn\\'t see me. Although he didn\\'t see me, I was still very angry, because I wasn\\'t going to be able to survive unless I get him to kill me. So I just quit and also got demoted and lost my item. This is why the Killer has such a HUGE advantage in the game. This also isn\\'t the only object I\\'ve gotten stuck into.I have recorded games I\\'ve played where my connection with the Killer was very bad, and I will perhaps upload them soon to my Steam profile/YouTube channel (Link on Profile!). So be sure to check those out if you would like to see more on what I\\'m talking about.Last but not least, hackers, yes, there are hackers already... And the game was only recently released, EVEN with an ANTI-CHEAT! This just really confuses me as to why their anti-cheat software hasn\\'t even banned these players yet. I saw a player who had prestiged his Claudette Morel to level 1000, which at this stage, is an impossible stage to even be on. Most players, almost all, haven\\'t even prestiged, including myself. TLDR: Game has more negatives than positives. ConclusionSo to conclude my review, this game needs more development. The game is great and fun, but when you take the negatives into account, Dead By Daylight isn\\'t really the best game to buy at this time. I believe the developers didn\\'t give enough time on their project and should have continued developing the game and released it at a later date. But the developers are still working on patches and have apparently said they wil be allowing people to invite their friends to public games instead of just private games. So to say they should be adding more patches as well.

Not know that this was an early access game I threw myself in to it hoping for a fresh game, one I haven't seen before. So I did what I usually do... Not look at anything on the game. Well now I wish I would and finding out that it was early access after I had played it makes it worse. I already have a dislike to early access as most games get forgotten and unfinished and I don't like the idea of paying for a game that hasn't even been finished and the devise thought they could get a couple of bucks out of it before they actually bother finish it. I know this isn't every early access game but a lot are like this. This game from the looks of it was either rushed, not cared about enough, or by inexperienced devise. Im sorry if it's the last option but you will need some helpful criticism. First of all I noticed the controls for the torch, these are horrible you can either not do anything and it will snap to the direction you are facing which leads to very disorientating gameplay ad there is no smooth animation for the snap lock and leaves the player felling more or less dizzy, or you can hold the left mouse button the whole time to control the torch which is annoying while trying to do platforming but is much easier then the snap control. This was very annoying through he whole game as you do have to use the torch as a weapon and making it a prime function without taking much care for smooth animation is not done well. While trying to find an option to maybe have it as a consonant on the mouse control I found myself exiting the level which made me instantly dislike this game. First of all there was no are you sure you want to exit the level, second no indication what so ever through the game did it say if you want to exit the level press ESC, this may not seem like that big of a deal and it wouldn't be in any other situation but in mine I was near the end of the level with all the collectibles and I had exited and was forced to play the level again but this time I ha dlost interest in collecting the letters. Another issue I have is that there are no options, none what so ever, except when you boot up the game it asks what graphics you would like windowed yes or no and resolution, for the very basic of settings these are there is no way to change them in game. One other thing that really bugged me about this game is the ... narrator, jeez can you come up with some different lines, every single level has the narrator saying the same thing over and over again, it's like a broken record, and I'm not kidding at the start of every level there is the same cut scene of the narrator saying some bull and during every level he says the same thing, and at the end of every level there is another cut scene. Not to be discouraging the narrator has a nice voice but maybe get him a few more then 3 things to say. Now one thing that really bugged me about the game play was that every time you die you go all the way top the start of the level usually this would be OK, it gives consequence to the players death but it is so easy to die in this game from the odd camera angle and the (let' face it) cliché platforming with no real unique aspect means you have to start the level again and when this happens you loose all of your collectibles. This is the most frustrating part because even though the platforming is hard simply because of other issue and not the way it is designed, a big portion of the game comes froms getting the collectibles and after dying a few time to some random issue I quickly lost interest in getting the collectibles which unlock additional levels, which I could not bring my self to even collect the letter to play because I found myself wanting to stop playing this game instantly. Another aspect of the game I didn't enjoy was the enemy if you can even call them that, there are two enemy's, white slug things that slowly move towards you and little white sperm things that move quickly towards you, for a game with the subtitle 'A game to fight inner demons' I did not find myself fighting any inner demons the most I got was having a good laugh at the ridiculous design of an 'inner demon' and the variation of these inner demons (the small sperm things) do not come in till the 4th level which is the second last level in the game. Which brings me to my next point the length of this game is ridiculous it is less then an hour I'm sure if you went through all the levels getting the collectibles it be a bit longer but no more then 2 hours it is ridiculous, if you are going to make a game with this kind of game play and non existent story telling at least make it long enough so people get their moneys worth. Another aspect I found odd was music or the lack of, the first time I heard music was in the last stage of the game and there was no epicness to it like in dark souls where music would only play during boss battles but dark souls made the iteration of music mean something, it made the player feel like they were doing something epic not bloody doing mundane platforming.So if you are looking to buy this game I wouldn't bother the $1 price it is definitely not worth it in the sate that it is in now.\", \"Completely bad.

It's at this point that the game stops being a survival game, an starts to be an unpaid fulltime job. See the promise of a survival game is that the longer you play, the more survivable & fun it becomes as you master your terrain. Ark on the other hand, the more work you put in, the more work there is to put in. Once you've built your house of straw, it's on to your house of wood, once you've got your house of wood, it's on to the house of stone & it's like that with literally everything in the game: There is no pay off.An if you are the least bit effective early on in the game, the leveling system outstrips the actual content, in that it stops being a survival game & rapidly becomes an eating, drinking & pooping simulator, because thats what you spend your entire time doing, as you wait for your xp to bring you up to the next level.As for the PVE aspects of the game they leave a lot to be desired. Dinosaurs just mill around, instead of moving with any purpose, and there are just way to heavily packed together on a map that is way to small. God help you if you don't stick to the beach the entire time, because predatory dinosaurs are so common place off the beach that it often feels like you are being Zerged by small predatory dinosaurs, or worse yet the insects.Which brings me to my next issue: Movement tracking. I don't mind combat with the dinosaurs, or at least i wouldn't if i ever got in to combat with the dinosaurs, rather than shadow boxing the fart of existance that the program thinks are the dinosaurs locations, when actually the dinosaur is three feet, that a way.The game lacks for telegraphing so dinos attack, before lacky banding back to the location they were in, without passing through the space between. The worst offenders are the spitting dinosaurs & the raptors, but it's alsoa problem with any of the insects, and even the Bronto's who kill you by magic apparently, because you'll never see what they hit you with.

Why?Because this PC port is complete .... Missing button presses was a frequent problem through my experience, no matter how many different keyboards and computers I played on. (tested on 5, btw) For example, During the final boss fight of Amy's campaign, during phase 3, I game-overed 3 times from full lives because of the missed presses. In the fight, you have to jump over an obstacle. In my experience, Amy jumped probably 3/4 of the time. Eventually I got so badly ...... off at the game, I borrowed a second USB keyboard just to double my button presses.This problem was only present in the Boss fights. There is literally no reason for this.Why do I say thats its OK then? Well, Sonic Adventure DX is on the fence on being Good or Bad. The cornyness of the cinematics makes it funny and good, but only seconds later, a glitch where you are thrown uncontrolably off a stage by a pickup, losing a life and possibly game-overing you makes it bad.
